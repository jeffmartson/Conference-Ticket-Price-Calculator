# Conference-Ticket-Price-Calculator
The "Conference Ticket Price Calculator" program is designed to facilitate the convenient and swift calculation of the total cost of tickets for your event. It offers an easy way to determine the participation cost for different age groups of attendees.

How It Works:
1. Enter the number of tickets you wish to purchase for the conference.
2. For each participant, input their age. Based on their age, the ticket price will be automatically determined:
   - Participants under 18 can attend the conference for free.
   - Participants aged 18 to 25 can purchase tickets at a rate of 990 rubles.
   - Participants above 25 can purchase tickets at the full price of 1390 rubles.
3. The program will display the total amount payable, considering applicable discounts. If you're registering more than three participants, you'll automatically receive a 10% discount on the full order price.

Benefits:
- A swift and intuitively understandable way to calculate participation costs for all attendees.
- Automated discount calculation for registering more than three participants.
- Flexible pricing approach based on participants' age.
